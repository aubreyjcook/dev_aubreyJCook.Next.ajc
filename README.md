Personal website built with Next.JS


## Statement of Purpose

This project is a personal website built with Next.JS. The purpose of this project is to create a personal website that showcases my work and provides a platform for me to share my thoughts and ideas. The website will include a homepage, a blog page, a portfolio page, and a contact page. The homepage will introduce me and provide links to the other pages. The blog page will contain posts about various topics that interest me. The portfolio page will showcase my work, including projects I have completed and projects I am currently working on. The contact page will provide a form for visitors to send me a message. The website will be built using Next.JS, a React framework that allows for server-side rendering and static site generation. The website will be deployed using Vercel, a cloud platform for static sites and serverless functions. Additionally, this project was created using Tailwind CSS and TypeScript.
